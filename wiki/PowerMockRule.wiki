= Bootstrapping using a JUnit Rule =
Since version 1.4 it's possible to bootstrap PowerMock using a [http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/07/junit-4.7-rules JUnit Rule] instead of using the PowerMockRunner and the RunWith annotation. This allows you to use other JUnit runners while still benefiting from PowerMock's functionality. You do this by specifying:

{{{
   @PrepareForTest(X.class);
   public class MyTest {
        @Rule
        PowerMockRule rule = new PowerMockRule();

        // Tests goes here
        ...
   }
}}}

== Using PowerMockRule with Maven ==
You need to depend on these projects:
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.powermock</groupId>
	<artifactId>powermock-module-junit4-rule</artifactId>
	<version>${powermock.version}</version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.powermock</groupId>
	<artifactId>powermock-classloading-xstream</artifactId>
	<version>${powermock.version}</version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
}}}
where `${powermock.version}` is the version of PowerMock you're currently using. You can also replace `powermock-classloading-xstream` with an Objenesis version:
{{{
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.powermock</groupId>
	<artifactId>powermock-classloading-objenesis</artifactId>
	<version>${powermock.version}</version>
	<scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
}}}
How ever this version is not as stable as the xstream version but it doesn't require any additional dependencies.
<br>
*Warning:* Use version PowerMock 1.4 (or later) since prior to this version the rule didn't actually execute any test methods (but it looked like it did).

== Using PowerMockRule without Maven ==
You need to download [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/powermock/powermock-module-junit4-rule/1.6.0/powermock-module-junit4-rule-1.6.0.jar powermock-module-junit4-rule], [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/powermock/powermock-classloading-base/1.6.0/powermock-classloading-base-1.6.0.jar powermock-classloading-base] and one of 
[http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/powermock/powermock-classloading-xstream/1.6.0/powermock-classloading-xstream-1.6.0.jar powermock-classloading-xstream] or [http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/powermock/powermock-classloading-objenesis/1.6.0/powermock-classloading-objenesis-1.6.0.jar powermock-classloading-objenesis] and put it in your classpath.
